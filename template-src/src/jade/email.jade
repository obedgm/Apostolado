                      p  Church We Believe was born in 1975. Seventeen denominations came together to form an agency "to do in partnership what none of us could hope to do as well alone." The mission: Feed the hungry, clothe the naked, heal the sick, comfort the aged, shelter the homeless.

                      p More than 68 years later the mission remains, though where and how we accomplish it has changed dramatically.
